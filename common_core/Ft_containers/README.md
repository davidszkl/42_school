# Ft_containers
This project makes you re-implement 3 STL containers from scratch along with other utility templates:
- Vector
- Stack, using your own vector
- Map, using a binary tree (Red-Black tree in this repo)

Concepts learned:
- STL containers inner workings
- Allocators usage
- Template programming
- Binary trees
- Unit tests
