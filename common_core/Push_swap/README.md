# Push_swap
42 stack-sorting project: code a program that will sort a stack of numbers in an optimized fashion using a few operations:
- sa: swap the 2 first elements of stack a.
- sb: swap the 2 first elements of stack b.
- ss: sa and sb at the same time.
- pa: push the first element from stack a to stack b.
- pb: push the first element from stack b to stack a.
- ra: move up 1 position all elements in stack a, first becomes the last one. 
- rb: move up 1 position all elements in stack b, first becomes the last one. 
- rr: ra and rb at the same time.
- rra: move down 1 position all elements in stack a, last becomes the first one. 
- rrb: move down 1 position all elements in stack b, last becomes the first one. 
- rrr: rra and rrb at the same time.

Concepts learned:
- Stack operations.
- Sorting algorithms and their optimisations.
